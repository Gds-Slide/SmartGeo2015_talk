note:
- network planning requires accurate & up to date data
- problem is: the world is rapidly changing everyday
    - when we are preparing for our quarterly map update, lots of areas and shops have now opened up since then
    - doesn't matter how many survey teams we send out, we can't keep up
- we crowdsource map feedback to TM internal staff which has helped increased by 70%
