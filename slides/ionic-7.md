- create
- build
- test
- deploy
- live reload

note:
Use just one command to create, build, test, and deploy your Ionic apps onto any platform. With amazing features like Live Reload and integrated logging, you'll already be miles ahead of your native frenemies. Just run npm install -g ionic, and you're good to go!
